<H1>ILS Demonstration</H1>
<P>Copyright &copy; 2001 by <A HREF="mailto:kadlecp2@fel.cvut.cz">Petr Kadlec</A>

<H2>User documentation</H2>

<P>The applet contains three parts: A horizontal map at the top, a vertical map in the middle,
and an instrument panel at the bottom.

<P>The horizontal map displays a part of a real-world ILS approach chart with an airport, which
has an ILS-equipped runway. On the map, an icon of an airplane is drawn, that can be controlled
by the user (see below).

<P>The vertical map displays another part of the approach chart. It displays the approach path
from side. Also on this map, an icon of the airplane is drawn.

<P>The instrument panel contains (left-to-right):
<UL>
<LI><B>Horizontal Situation Indicator</B> (HSI), which indicates the position of the airplane
relative to the ILS beams and includes a (gyro-) compass</LI>
<LI>(Barometric) <B>Altimeter</B>, which indicates current altitude of the airplane in feet
above mean sea level (if properly set). It has three needles: The biggest one shows hundreds,
the short one shows thousands, and the long thin one with a triangle on one end shows tens of
thousands of feet.</LI>
<LI><B>Marker indicators</B> - The respective light is lit when the airplane is flying over
a marker. A respective sound is also played in that moment (if your computer is capable of
that, of course).</LI>
<LI><B>DME display</B>, which shows current distance of the airplane from the DME transmitter
(in nautical miles, 1&nbsp;nm&nbsp;=&nbsp;1852&nbsp;meters&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.15&nbsp;statute mile).
(In reality, the DME display usually also displays a speed of the airplane, and sometimes also
an estimate of time required to reach the navaid.)</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Controlling the airplane</H3>

<P>You can control the airplane in a way that partly imitates the real world flying. If you
press left or right arrow, the airplane turns left or right, respectively. If you press up
or down arrow, the airplane nose lowers down, or raises up, as it would move if you would push
the control wheel in a real airplane in the same direction. Then, if you press space, the
airplane moves a bit forward.

<P>The objective is to keep the airplane on the proper aproach path and to "land" the airplane
correctly on the runway. You should be able to do that only by looking on the instruments, not
on maps! It is the reason you use ILS - you do not see anything other than your instruments in
bad weather!

<P>If you want to experiment of what the instruments would display in some point of the map,
you could also click with the left mouse button on the point on the upper map. With the
right mouse button you turn the airplane. A click with the left button on the lower map changes
the airplane's altitude. A right mouse click on the lower map changes the airplane's pitch.

<H2>Applet requirements</H2>

<P>The applet requires that the browser supports Java 2 API. This support is not usually present
in the default Java VM installation in Microsoft Internet Explorer. You have to upgrade your
Java Runtime Environment or use a better browser.

<P>If you want to hear the marker indication sounds, Java implementation in your browser must
support WAVE audioclips, and your computer must have a properly configured sound card.

<H2>Including the applet on a HTML page</H2>

<P>If you want to include the applet on your page, you have to add the following tag to your
html code:

<P><CODE><PRE>
&lt;APPLET
  CODE     = "ils/ILSDemo.class"
  NAME     = "ILSDemo"
  WIDTH    = 532
  HEIGHT   = 556
  HSPACE   = 0
  VSPACE   = 0
  ALIGN    = top
&gt;
&lt;/APPLET&gt;
</PRE></CODE>

<P>In the <CODE>CODEBASE</CODE> property, you can set a location from which the applet
(the classes and media files) will be downloaded. You should not change the <CODE>WIDTH</CODE>
and <CODE>HEIGHT</CODE> properties, since the applet has fixed size.

<P>If you use this applet on your pages, don't forget to mention me as the author!
