<H2>ILS Purpose</H2>
<P>ILS (<I>Instrument Landing System</I>) is a system of radio devices used by
aircrafts flying in a non-visual meteorological conditions when on the final part of
the landing. This system helps pilots to navigate their airplanes towards the runway
equipped with ILS.

<H2>ILS Functionality</H2>
<P>The ILS consists of two electronic beams (i.e. transmitters which transmit
highly directional radio emissions): one provides horizontal guidance (the so-called
localizer); the other, vertical guidance (the so-called glideslope). In addition to
these beams, a DME device is usually placed at the runway threshold. Moreover, two
(or three) marker beacons are normally used, which provide additional information about
distance from runway threshold.
<P>The localizer transmitter emits a radio beam in direction of runway centerline.
The glidepath transmitter emits a radio beam in the same direction, but the beam is
elevated at a glidepath angle from ground (usually 3°). The DME provides precise distance
information from the runway threshold. The marker beacons are antenna arrays which emit
a vertical beam to indicate the pilot that his airplane is at a specific point. Ordinarily,
there are two marker beacons associated with an ILS, the OM (<I>Outer Marker</I>) and MM
(<I>Middle Marker</I>). Locations with a Category II and III ILS also have an <I>Inner
Marker</I> (IM). When an aircraft passes over a marker, a light will light in the cabin
and pilot will hear a specific sound pattern:

<H2>Using ILS</H2>
<P>When pilot wants to use ILS, he tunes its localizer frequency on the primary NAV receiver.
The glideslope frequency is fixedly paired with the localizer frequency, so it is
tuned automatically. Both needles on the HSI now display the deviation of the aircraft
from the extended runway centerline and glideslope. The DME receiver displays distance
to the runway threshold. Pilot should fly "towards the needles" to position the airplane
on the best approach path. The marker beacons have fixed frequencies, so the pilot
does not tune them at all. (Moreover, it often happens that aircraft receives marker
beacon's signal in another phase of flight, when by chance overflying some marker
beacon.)

<H2>ILS Demonstration</H2>
<P>Using this applet you can try what a pilot sees on an ILS approach. Press arrow keys to
turn the airplane, press space to move the airplane a bit forward. Try to navigate the airplane
to the runway.
<P>You can also click with a left mouse button on the upper map to position the airplane, or
click with the right mouse button to turn the airplane towards the selected point. On the lower
map, you can click with the left button to change the altitude of the airplane, or with the
right button to turn the airplane's nose up or down.
<P>The instruments at the bottom are (from the left):
<UL>
<LI><B>Horizontal Situation Indicator</B> (HSI), which indicates your position relative to
the ILS beams and includes a (gyro-) compass</LI>
<LI>(Barometric) <B>Altimeter</B>, which indicates your current altitude in feet above mean
sea level (if properly set). It has three needles: The biggest one shows hundreds, the short
one shows thousands, and the long thin one with a triangle on one end shows tens of thousands
of feet.</LI>
<LI><B>Marker indicators</B> - The respective light is lit when the airplane is flying over
a marker.</LI>
<LI><B>DME display</B>, which shows your current distance from the DME transmitter (in nautical
miles, 1&nbsp;nm&nbsp;=&nbsp;1852&nbsp;meters&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.15&nbsp;statute mile). (In reality,
the DME display usually also displays a speed of the airplane, and sometimes also an estimate
of time required to reach the navaid.)</LI>
