<H1>Karel Compiler</H1>

<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>This document describes the Karel compiler, which is a Java application that
compiles programs written in the Karel programming language to Java class files
that can be run on any computer with Java Virtual Machine.

<H2>Usage</H2>
<P>The program source is compiled with the following command:
<PRE><CODE>java -jar Karel.jar <VAR>sourcefile destclass</VAR></PRE></CODE>
Where <VAR>sourcefile</VAR> is name of the file containing source text of your
Karel program and destclass is name you have chosen for the class which will
be created from the Karel source. The file which will be created, will have the
name <CODE><VAR>destclass</VAR>.class</CODE>

<H2>Running Karel programs</H2>
<P>The resulting class file is a standard Java class file, i.e. to start the
program, use <CODE>java <VAR>destclass</VAR></CODE> as in case of any other Java
program. You only have to enable the Java runtime environment to find
<CODE>karel.common</CODE> and <CODE>karel.city</CODE> packages.
